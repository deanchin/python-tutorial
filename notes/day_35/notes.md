### Create a sample program to learn more

Should have the following capabilities:
* Allow storing a time that you choose
* Tell the difference between current time and the time you stored
* Display the time in a different timezone
* Calculate what the datetime would be 60 days from now
* If is store a date/time (figure out what timezone I am in and convert it to UTC and push to database)
* Convert from UTC to user timezone
* Can you determine what timezone the system is using?

Authentication Mechanism Types:
* Basic Authentication
    - Use a user name and password to authenticate
* Json Web Tokens (JWT)
    - Use a token so that plain text password is not transmitted
