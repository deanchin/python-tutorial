# Day 09 - Test Driven Development (TDD) with pytest

## Overview

A good practice that strong developers follow is to write tests for their code.
This concept is called unit testing.

Test Driven Development:
Writing  unit test first, then write code to make the test pass.

## One time setup for pytest

```bash
# Installing the necessary packages for pytest using requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Run pytest watcher

To continuously watch for file changes and run pytest, you can run ptw.

```bash
# Run the following command
ptw -- -vv
```

## Side Notes

Agile Scrum.
Sprint is an iteration (usually 2 weeks long).

* Story is a small unit of work with requirements on what needs to be accomplished.
